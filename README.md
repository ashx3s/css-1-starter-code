# CSS Lab Activity

This Lord of the Rings Food html page has been created with the help of Claude AI. However it demonstrates effective semantic html organization.

The purpose of this codebase is to help students practice working with css. Your job is to style this content.

## Instructions

1. Fix the image paths to use the images from this directory
2. Link the css file to the html file
3. Implement CSS!

** Scope Limitation: Just focus on Desktop screen size**

### CSS Properties to Focus on

- Class selectors
- Descendant selectors
- Selector list (i.e., multiple selectors)
- CSS properties:

  - margin
  - font-family
  - font-size
  - font-weight
  - font-style
  - text-decoration
  - line-height
  - text-align

### Useful Questions to Consider
