        <h2>A Journey Through the Foods of Middle-earth</h2>
      </header>

        <p>
          The diverse cultures of Middle-earth each possess their own unique culinary traditions,
          shaped by their environments, values, and ways of life. From the rolling hills of the
          Shire to the dark fortresses of Mordor, food plays a central role in defining the
          character and customs of each race.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bounty of Middle-earth varies greatly across its lands. In some places, tables groan
          under the weight of fresh breads, sweet pastries, and garden vegetables. In others,
          sustenance is scarce and practical, designed only to fuel the body for battle or labor.
          Understanding the food of Middle-earth offers insight into the hearts and minds of its
          inhabitants.

          This guide explores the dining customs of three distinct peoples: the comfort-loving
          Hobbits, the industrious Elves, and the fearsome Orcs. Each approach to food tells a
          story of their priorities, their relationship with nature, and their place in the grand
          tapestry of Middle-earth's history.

        <h3>Hobbit Cuisine</h3>

        <p>
          Hobbits are renowned throughout Middle-earth for their love of good food and plentiful
          meals. With seven meals a day—including breakfast, second breakfast, elevenses, luncheon,
          afternoon tea, dinner, and supper—Hobbits have elevated eating to an art form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their cuisine features hearty fare from the Shire's fertile lands: crusty bread, yellow
          butter, cheese, bacon, mushrooms, potatoes, and an abundance of garden vegetables. Seed
          cakes, scones, and jam tarts are particular favorites for elevenses and tea time.

        <h3>Elvish Delicacies</h3>

        <p>
          Elven food reflects their refined nature and deep connection to the natural world.
          Their meals are elegant and nourishing, designed to sustain their immortal bodies
          without excess. Lembas bread, the famous waybread of the Elves, can sustain a traveler
          for an entire day with just one small cake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elves favor fruits, nuts, honey, and delicate pastries. They drink fine wines and clear
          spring water, and their feasts are legendary for their beauty and abundance. Every meal
          is treated as a celebration of life and the gifts of the earth.

        <h3>Orcish Rations</h3>
        <img src="./images/orc-potatoes.jpg" alt="Rotten Potatoes">
        <p>
          Orc food is as brutal and utilitarian as the Orcs themselves. Sustenance is viewed
          purely as fuel for warfare and labor, with little thought given to taste or presentation.
          Their rations consist of dried meats, stale bread, and a foul drink that sustains them
          on long marches.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Orcs of Isengard received slightly better fare than their counterparts in Mordor,
          including a mysterious "meat" that even Orcs questioned. Whatever the source, Orcish
          cuisine prioritizes efficiency and endurance over all else, reflecting their harsh
          existence in service to darkness.
